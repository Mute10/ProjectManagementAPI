Project Management API

A powerful backend API for managing the entire lifecycle of projects and tasks. Built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL, this system enables users to create, update, track, and analyze projects through clearly defined phases such as initiation, planning, execution, review, and completion.

## Features

- Create and manage projects with optional descriptions and timelines
- Track task statuses across multiple project phases
- Full CRUD operations for projects and tasks
- Data persistence using PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy ORM
- Clean separation of logic, database models, and API routing
- Designed for performance and clarity in real-world backend environments
- Optional CLI support for local usage and automation

## Why

- Real-world CRUD implementations
- Separation of concerns between database models, business logic, and API layers
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Readability and testability

## Tech Stack

- FastAPI — high-performance web framework
- PostgreSQL — relational database
- SQLAlchemy — ORM for database modeling
- Pydantic — data validation and schema management
- unittest — Python built-in testing framework

 
## Installation

```bash

1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Mute10/ProjectManagementAPI.git
cd ProjectManagementAPI

2. Set up virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure PostgreSQL database
 Update connection string in tools.py or via environment variables

5. Run the app
uvicorn API:app --reload


## Usage:

Access Swagger UI at: http://localhost:8000/docs
Use curl, Postman, or the CLI (if configured) to create and manage projects and tasks
All tasks are tied to projects and move through lifecycle phases


Run tests with:
python -m unittest file.py
